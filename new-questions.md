Gist: if the character set is small, say lowercase english alphabets, you can create an array, where index 0 corresponds to 'a', index 1 to 'b' and index 25 to 'z'. This array can be used to store the number of times each character is seen in the string. Do this for both strings and then compare the count arrays. \
