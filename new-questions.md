**Question:** find if 2 strings are anagrams of each other

**Answer link:** [Check whether two strings are anagrams](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-whether-two-strings-are-anagram-of-each-other/) (approach 2)

**Gist:** If the character set is small, say lowercase english alphabets, you can create an array, where index 0 corresponds to `'a'`, index 1 to `'b'` and index 25 to `'z'`. This array can be used to store the number of times each character is seen in the string. Do this for both strings and then compare the count arrays.
